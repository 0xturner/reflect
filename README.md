Each day, users are prompted to fill out a "reflection" form. The app then uses natural language proccessing (via [Natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural)) to analyze the text-sentiment behind the user's answers in order to produce a mood score. Additionally, this app tracks the user's computer productivity data through [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/). Reflect compiles these sets of data and present them as graphs on the dashboard. Users can then observe how their productivity affects their mood and vice versa.
